# Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

* Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

 Software engineeering is a systematic,  disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. The field encompasses a comprehensive approach to creating reliable and efficient software solutions, by applying engineering pinciples and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet specific user needs. 

 **Importance**
- It supports the continous evolution of technology by fostering the development of cutting-edge applications, such as AI which are increasingly impoirtant to the society.
- It provides a systematic and disciplined approach to software development which is essential for managing the complexity of large-scale projects and ensuring that software meets specific user needs.
- It drives innovation by enabling the creation of new applications, products and services that can transform various industries and improve many people's lives.
- Ensure reliability by implementing proper parctices taht reduce the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures, which is important for critical applications such as finance and healthcare.

* Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- **1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering**. The term **software engineering** was coined during this conference, which addressed the software crisis of the 1960s. The crisis was characterized by projects plagued by cost overruns, delays, and unreliable systems. This marked the formal recognition of software development as a disciplined filed requiring systematic practices, setting the stage for structural methodologies, standards, and academic research in software engineering.
- **Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)**. Pioneered by Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming emphasized clear, modular code using control structures like loops and conditionals instead of unstructured like ``goto``. Key languages likr ALGOL and Pascal embodied these principles. This reduced code complexity, improved readability, and enhanced mainatinability, laying the groundwork for managing large-scale software projects. 
- **Agile Methodologies**. The Agile Manifesto prioritized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid processes like Waterfall. This shifted software development toward flexibility and continous delivery, addressing the limitations of earlier methodologies.


* List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


* Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


* Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


* Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


* What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


* Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


* Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


* Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
