## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

* Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

 Software engineeering is a systematic,  disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. The field encompasses a comprehensive approach to creating reliable and efficient software solutions, by applying engineering pinciples and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet specific user needs. 

 **Importance**
- It supports the continous evolution of technology by fostering the development of cutting-edge applications, such as AI which are increasingly impoirtant to the society.
- It provides a systematic and disciplined approach to software development which is essential for managing the complexity of large-scale projects and ensuring that software meets specific user needs.
- It drives innovation by enabling the creation of new applications, products and services that can transform various industries and improve many people's lives.
- Ensure reliability by implementing proper parctices taht reduce the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures, which is important for critical applications such as finance and healthcare.

* Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- **1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering**. The term **software engineering** was coined during this conference, which addressed the software crisis of the 1960s. The crisis was characterized by projects plagued by cost overruns, delays, and unreliable systems. This marked the formal recognition of software development as a disciplined filed requiring systematic practices, setting the stage for structural methodologies, standards, and academic research in software engineering.
- **Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)**. Pioneered by Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming emphasized clear, modular code using control structures like loops and conditionals instead of unstructured like ``goto``. Key languages likr ALGOL and Pascal embodied these principles. This reduced code complexity, improved readability, and enhanced mainatinability, laying the groundwork for managing large-scale software projects. 
- **Agile Methodologies**. The Agile Manifesto prioritized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid processes like Waterfall. This shifted software development toward flexibility and continous delivery, addressing the limitations of earlier methodologies.


* List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- **Planning**. The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benfit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation. The development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document.
- **Design**. In this phase software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. 
- **Implementation**. This phase involves writing the code, testing, and debugging the software.
- **Testing**. The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs. quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets customer requirements. It runs parallel to the development phase.
- **Deployment**. The software is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation.
- **Maintenance**. This phase involves fixing bugs, updating the software, and adding new features to the software.

* Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

## Waterfall vs. Agile

- **Waterfall** suits predictable, structured projects with minimal uncertainty.  
- **Agile** excels in fast-paced environments where adaptability and frequent feedback are critical

### Key Differences

| **Aspect**          | **Waterfall**                          | **Agile**                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Linear, sequential phases              | Iterative cycles (sprints)             |
| **Flexibility**      | Rigid; changes are costly               | Adaptable; welcomes evolving requirements |
| **Documentation**    | Heavy upfront planning                 | Minimal, adaptive documentation        |
| **Customer Involvement** | Limited to initial/final stages    | Continuous collaboration               |
| **Delivery**         | Single release at project end           | Incremental releases (e.g., every 2â€“4 weeks) |
| **Risk Management**  | Risks identified late in the process    | Early and frequent risk mitigation     |

### When to Use Each

#### **Waterfall**  

- **Predictable projects**: Projects with well-defined requirements, minimal uncertainty, and a clear scope.
- **Fixed requirements**: Projects with clear, unchanging specifications (e.g., bridge construction, aerospace systems).

* What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges software engineers face are many and below is a list of some of them.  

a. **Work-Life Balance & Burnout**
Tight deadlines and high pressure can lead to exhaustion.

Strategies :
- Advocate for realistic deadlines and prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix .
- Practice time-blocking and take regular breaks (e.g., Pomodoro Technique).
- Promote a culture of sustainable pace in Agile teams.

b. **Collaboration & Communication Gaps**
Misalignment within teams or with stakeholders can cause duplicated efforts or missed deadlines.

Strategies :
- Leverage collaboration tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) and project management platforms (Jira, Trello).
- Hold daily standups and retrospectives to sync priorities.
- Document decisions in shared spaces (e.g., GitHub Wikis, Notion).

c. **Changing Requirements**
Clients or stakeholders may alter requirements mid-project, leading to scope creep and delays.

Strategies :
- Adopt Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) to embrace iterative development and regular feedback.
- Use user stories and prototypes to clarify expectations early.
- Document requirements with flexibility (e.g., "living" specs in tools like Confluence).

d. **Technical Debt**
Accumulated shortcuts or suboptimal code can hinder maintainability and scalability.

Strategies :
- Schedule regular refactoring sessions to improve code quality.
- Implement automated testing (unit, integration, and regression tests) to catch issues early.
- Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) to identify debt hotspots.

e. **Debugging Complex Systems**
Identifying and resolving bugs in large, distributed systems can be time-consuming.

Strategies :
- Use debugging tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Visual Studio Debugger) and logging frameworks (e.g., ELK Stack).
- Adopt pair programming or code reviews to catch issues early.
- Write reproducible test cases to isolate bugs.

f. **Keeping Up with Technology**
Rapid advancements in tools and frameworks can lead to skill obsolescence.
Strategies :

- Dedicate time to continuous learning (online courses, Pluralsight, Coursera).
- Participate in hackathons or open-source projects to experiment with new tech.
- Follow industry blogs (e.g., Dev.to, Medium) and attend conferences (e.g., AWS re:Invent).

* Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. **Unit Testing**. Tests inndividual components like classes and methods in isolation. Its aim is to verify that each unit works as is intended. The Developers perform it or it is automated. 

The importance of it is:
- It catches bugs early in the development making it cost effective.
- It simplifies debugging by isolating code units.
- It ensures that the code is maintainable and scalable.

2. **Integration testing**. Tests interactions between integrated modules or services. the goal is to ensure components work together as expected. It is performed by the Developers or QA Engineers. 

The importance is:
- It ensures that the components work together seamlessly.
- It identifies integration issues early.
- It reduces the risk of downstream problems.

3. **System Testing**. This is end-to-end testing of the entire system. It validates that the software meets specific requirements. It is performed by QA Engineers. 

The importance is:
- Ensures the system works holistically in a production-like environment.
- Validates non-functional requirements like performance and security.

4. **Acceptance Testing**. Validates whether the software meets business or user needs. The objective is to confirm readiness for deployment. It is performed by Stakeholders, End Users, and QA Engineers.

The importance is:
- Ensures the software meets business requirements and user expectations.
- Validates the software is ready for production.


### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


* Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt engineering** is the process of designing, refining, and optimizing inputs/prompts to guide AI models such as large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate outputs. It involves understanding how to structure queries, provide context, and iteratively adjust inputs to achieve desired results. 

Prompt engineering is important in this way:
- It enables effective communication between humans and machines.
- It improves the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs.
- It reduces the risk of misinterpretation or misapplication of AI-generated content.
- It enhances the overall user experience by providing more accurate and helpful responses.
- Bias reduction as AI models may inherit bias from training data, leading to skewed outputs. 

* Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

*What is networking?*  
 In the above prompt, the user will not be able to get a helpful response as they are an IT student, and the response/output will be about networking-making connections in a social gathering-instead of on computer networking. Leaves them frustrated but in reality, it is their vague prompt and lack of being particular that got them the wrong response.

An improved prompt that will get them a better more accurate response will look like this:
  *I am an IT student in my 1.1 module and I want you to teach me more about Computer Networking. As I am completely new to this, avoid technival jargon and suggest improvements to my prompts so that I may gain more from our intercation. Be concise and ask me questions to help you understand how much I retained from the interaction and from that Identify areas that I need more study.*
